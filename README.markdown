# haskell-sscgi

Why another SCGI library? The maintainer of the [scgi library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scgi) was not accepting packages (this was before it was marked as deprecated). For a while I maintained a fork, but eventually decided to get rid of some of the complexity and design decisions introduced by `Network.CGI`.

I do not use this library anymore as I now prefer direct HTTP.
